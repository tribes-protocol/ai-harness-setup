# Drive-first contract for the sandbox-wide zipbox skill installation (#1914).
#
# The terminal repo's dockers/Dockerfile.harnesses bakes skills/<slug>/ and
# install-skills.sh onto the shared read-only drive at /opt/harnesses/skills
# (0444 files / 0555 dirs). This test simulates that bake on the disposable
# GitHub runner (as root — the production paths are deliberately fixed at
# /opt/harnesses/skills and /root/skills) with a DEAD network (a curl fixture
# that records every attempt and fails), and pins:
#
#   1. stock path (no template pin): installs by symlinking the baked catalog
#      into /root/skills WITHOUT any network attempt, replacing prior copies,
#      keeping unrelated local skills, and wiring loaders + AGENTS routes
#   2. re-run: fully idempotent, still no network attempt
#   3. pinned TRIBES_HARNESS_REF + fetch fails + complete install in place:
#      the fetch is attempted, and the existing installation is kept untouched
#   4. pinned TRIBES_HARNESS_REF + fetch fails + INCOMPLETE install: the drive
#      fallback reconverges the catalog
