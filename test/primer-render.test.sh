# Regression test for the FROZEN PRIMER bug.
#
# bootstrap.sh runs ONCE and its sed CONSUMES the AGENTS.md placeholders, so every
# value it stamped is frozen for the life of the disk. Two ways that was wrong:
#
#   1. __HOST__  — the guest's OS hostname is the BOOT SLUG (the baked warm-pool
#      name). A claim adds the chosen name as a DNS alias + vhost and does NOT
#      reboot the VM, so `hostname` never becomes the claimed public name. A box
#      bootstrapped in the warm pool froze a primer reading "you are live at
#      <pool-slug>". AGENTS.md is auto-loaded into the agent's context, so the
#      agent was fed a WRONG public URL by default (observed: a box answering
#      "dapper-bison.machina.wtf" when it was actually kobo-h5-ai1.machina.wtf).
#   2. identity — a box bootstrapped BEFORE its agent_identities row was bound had
#      no TRIBES_IDENTITY_* in env, so email/EVM/SOL froze as "none" permanently.
#
# render-primer.sh runs on EVERY launch from the untouched template with the live
# env, so both self-heal. This test simulates a RESTORED/ALREADY-BOOTSTRAPPED disk
# (primer already rendered with the wrong values) and asserts the next launch
# repairs it, and that the repair is stable across repeats (restore-safe).
#
# POSIX sh. Run: sh test/primer-render.test.sh

# ── 8/9. THE BUG THAT SHIPPED INERT ──────────────────────────────────────────
# bootstrap.sh and render-primer.sh resolved their fetch ref from HOST_HARNESS_REF
# — the HOST DAEMON's variable name, which is NEVER injected into the guest. The
# guest only ever sees TRIBES_HARNESS_REF. So every runtime fetch silently fell
# back to `main`, regardless of the pin: a box pinned to a tag fetched main's
# AGENTS.md and 404'd on main/render-primer.sh, leaving the primer un-rendered on
# EVERY box. The pin, the immutable tag, the freeze and the pool drain were all
# defeated by this one name. These assert the guest variable WINS.
