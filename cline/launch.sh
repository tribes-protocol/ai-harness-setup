# Cline harness launch — runs on EVERY launch, as root, cwd /root/workspace, sh.
# Cline's auth is a file the `cline auth` command writes (~/.cline/data/settings/
# providers.json) — there is no committed seed config and no env-based config.

# --- restore-safety: (re-)auth the proxy provider from the LIVE env ---------
# The auth command runs HERE, every launch — not only in bootstrap.sh — so each
# boot re-auths with a freshly-minted bearer. The bearer is a short-lived ES256
# JWT minted in-VM by tribes-agent-token (signed with the P-256 agent key); a
# restored disk still carries the OLD providers.json token (now stale -> proxy
# 401), so only a live re-auth refreshes it. Idempotent — re-running just
# overwrites the provider file. Skipped on a keyless BYO/unset box so the user's own creds stand.

# --- shared agent skills: reconverge on every launch -------------------------
# Drive-first (#1914): run the installer baked onto the shared read-only
# /opt/harnesses drive, so every launch reconverges /root/skills on the drive's
# pinned catalog with no network. The fetch survives as the fallback for a
# drive that predates skills (old image, dev backend) and for a pinned
# TRIBES_HARNESS_REF (QA), which must exercise that branch's own installer.
# Tolerant + tight timeout; a slow or failed fetch leaves the launch (and any
# prior install) unaffected.
