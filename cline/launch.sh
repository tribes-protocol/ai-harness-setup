# Cline harness launch — runs on EVERY launch, as root, cwd /root/workspace, sh.
# Cline's auth is a file the `cline auth` command writes (~/.cline/data/settings/
# providers.json) — there is no committed seed config and no env-based config.

# --- restore-safety: (re-)auth the proxy provider from the LIVE env ---------
# The auth command runs HERE, every launch — not only in bootstrap.sh — so a
# PAUSE -> RESTORE picks up the re-minted TRIBES_API_KEY. The control plane
# REVOKES the old token and injects a fresh TRIBES_API_KEY on the boot cmdline,
# but the restored disk still carries the OLD providers.json token (now revoked ->
# proxy 401); only a live re-auth refreshes it. Idempotent — re-running just
# overwrites the provider file. Skipped on BYO/unset so the user's own creds stand.

# --- proxy-routed but NO credential: fail LOUD, don't boot silently broken ----
# The proxy guard above skips config when TRIBES_API_KEY is empty — correct for a
# BYO box (all three env vars unset). But a box the control plane marked
# proxy-routed (TRIBES_LLM_MODEL + API_BASE_URL present) that arrives with an
# EMPTY TRIBES_API_KEY is a FAILED credential mint, not BYO: it boots, every LLM
# call 401s (totalTokens:0), and every other vantage reads green. Surface it — a
# loud boot-log line AND a health marker the fleet can poll — so "booted with no
# proxy auth" is no longer silent. Cleared on any healthy/BYO boot so the marker
# is a LIVE signal (self-heals on a restore that re-mints the key). (#2472)
