# grok harness — bootstrap (runs ONCE, as root, cwd /root/workspace, under sh).
# Installs the xAI grok CLI and stamps the host into AGENTS.md. grok's only
# FILE-based config is its theme (.grok/config.toml, committed as a SEED FILE with
# a __TRIBES_THEME__ placeholder) — we fill that placeholder HERE from the
# create-time TRIBES_THEME so the file is valid (no raw placeholder) and survives
# the end-of-bootstrap safety net. launch.sh re-seds it each launch so a theme
# toggle takes effect on relaunch. grok's proxy is ENV-only (GROK_* vars), in launch.sh.
# Config paths are $HOME-relative — the dispatcher decides HOME (old: workspace,
# new: /root).

# matched here. AGENTS.md only carries __HOST__ and __EMAIL__ (both filled above), so it is not matched either. This
# only fires if some file slips through unfilled.
# NEVER delete *.sh — bootstrap.sh/launch.sh legitimately contain __TRIBES_ in
# their sed patterns/fallbacks; only NON-script files with a raw placeholder are
# broken config and get removed.

# boot runs the baked copy and needs no network for skills. The installer is
# fetched only when the drive predates skills (old image, dev backend) or a

# Runs after all config writes; fully tolerant, so it never blocks or fails
