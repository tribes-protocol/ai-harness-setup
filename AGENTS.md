# Your sandbox

You are **root** in a disposable Debian Linux microVM with its own kernel — fully isolated. Break it freely; nothing here can reach the user's machine.

- **Install anything.** Missing a tool, runtime, or library? Just install it (`apt-get install -y ...`, `npm i -g ...`, `pip install ...`) — no need to ask.
- **Home directory:** `/root/workspace` — there's no per-user account; everything runs as root, and the microVM itself is the isolation boundary.
- **Public URL:** this VM is live at `https://__HOST__` — anything you serve is reachable there over HTTPS.
- **Expose on IPv6 only:** the VM has a dedicated public IPv6 address. Bind public servers to `[::]`, not `0.0.0.0` — IPv4 is not routable on this subdomain (`ip -6 addr show dev eth0` shows the address).

## API keys & outbound calls (read before your first API call)

- **Use the default environment.** Login shells source `/etc/profile.d/*.sh`, where the platform pre-sets your provider API keys and `ZIPBOX_EGRESS_PROXY_URL`. **Never overwrite, unset, or "fix" a pre-set `*_API_KEY`** — the value is a platform-allocated placeholder that is swapped for a real key at the egress proxy, and your billing rides on it.
- **LLM calls:** the pre-set key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`) works as-is through the platform. If a provider call returns 401, the fix is to route through the proxy (below) — not to replace the key.
- **Third-party APIs:** route through the metered proxy: `export HTTPS_PROXY="$ZIPBOX_EGRESS_PROXY_URL" HTTP_PROXY="$ZIPBOX_EGRESS_PROXY_URL"` — see the `zipbox-egress` skill for the placeholder slots per provider.
- **Opting out is allowed but self-serviced:** bypass the proxy only with your OWN valid provider key. The placeholder works only through the proxy; sent directly to a provider it will 401 every time.
