#!/bin/sh
# Pi harness launch — runs on EVERY launch, as root, cwd /root/workspace, sh.
# Pi is fully FILE-based (models.json + settings.json). There is NO env-based
# config to export here, and pi's theme is "light/dark" (its Automatic mode — it
# queries OSC at startup and follows the terminal), so no per-launch theme rewrite
# is needed either. What DOES run every launch is the models.json (re)generation
# below — the one thing that must NOT be baked once at bootstrap.

# --- (re)generate models.json from the LIVE env every boot ------------------
# Two problems this fixes, both from doing it ONCE in bootstrap.sh:
#   1. token freshness: the placeholder is a provider placeholder supplied in-VM by
#      the platform-provided OpenRouter placeholder (signed with the P-256 agent key). Refreshing every launch
#      keeps the on-disk apiKey a live, unexpired token — including after a PAUSE ->
#      RESTORE, where the disk still holds the previous boot's now-stale placeholder.
#   2. empty-catalog self-heal: the catalog comes from an authenticated GET
#      /models; a first-boot empty/401 fetch would otherwise be BAKED IN forever
#      ("No models available"). Re-fetching every boot lets the next boot recover,
#      and an empty fetch falls back to the single default model (never an empty
#      array) — mirroring opencode/openclaw.
# No-op-equivalent on a cold boot (rewrites identical content); skipped on BYO/unset
# (bootstrap removed models.json, so the -f guard is false; pi uses the user's
# creds). Config paths are $HOME-relative — the dispatcher decides HOME.
# --- re-render the agent primer (restore-safety, like the token refresh) -----
# bootstrap.sh's sed CONSUMED the primer placeholders, freezing whatever the box
# knew at first boot: the boot-slug hostname (a claim adds a DNS alias and never
# renames the VM) and "none" identity values if the agent_identities row wasn't
# bound yet. AGENTS.md is auto-loaded into the agent's context, so a frozen primer
# feeds it a WRONG public URL by default. Re-render from the untouched template
# with this launch's live env so both self-heal and survive restore.

# drive that predates skills (old image, dev backend) and for a pinned
# TRIBES_HARNESS_REF (QA), which must exercise that branch's own installer.
# Tolerant + tight timeout; a slow or failed fetch leaves the launch (and any
# prior install) unaffected.

# --- close the direct-provider escape hatch (#2255) --------------------------
# On a platform-funded box the control plane injects a PLACEHOLDER OPENROUTER_API_KEY
# (SandboxBootEnv.ts) intended for an egress injector that swaps in the real key.
# On zipbox no such injector is on this path, so the placeholder is just a stray
# credential-shaped env var: harnesses that auto-register a provider on env
# presence alone (pi, opencode) can pick OpenRouter DIRECTLY and 401 against
# openrouter.ai instead of using the metered proxy. Dropping it before exec leaves
# the metered proxy as the only route the harness can see.
#
# We do NOT set HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY: the forwarder catalog is a CONNECT
# allowlist that 403s every non-catalog authority, so a blanket proxy would break
# github/npm/apt/pypi on every box.
#
# The unset is deliberately guard-scoped, NOT value-scoped (i.e. not "unset only
# if it looks like the placeholder"). Value-matching would couple this script to a
# literal defined in another repo's catalog — a silent no-op the day that value
# changes — and, worse, it would PRESERVE a real OpenRouter key that reached a
# platform-funded box some other way, which is exactly the unmetered bypass this
# closes. byoKey is the supported way to bring your own key, and it is suppressed
# by the guard below.
#
# The guard is the by-construction one: SandboxBootEnv writes TRIBES_LLM_MODEL
# ONLY for proxy-mode, non-byoKey, non-'external' boxes, so BYO/external boxes
# never enter this branch and keep their own OPENROUTER_API_KEY untouched. This is
# structural, not a special case — do not add a byoKey conditional here.
# --- platform-funded but NO credential: fail LOUD, don't boot silently broken ----
# The proxy guard above skips config when the platform key is empty — correct for a
# BYO box (all three env vars unset). But a box the control plane marked
# platform-funded (TRIBES_LLM_MODEL + OPENROUTER_API_KEY present) that arrives with an
# EMPTY $token (the platform-provided OpenRouter placeholder supplied nothing) is a FAILED provider-key delivery, not BYO: it boots, every LLM
# call 401s (totalTokens:0), and every other vantage reads green. Surface it — a
# loud boot-log line AND a health marker the fleet can poll — so "booted with no
# proxy auth" is no longer silent. Cleared on any healthy/BYO boot so the marker
# is a LIVE signal (self-heals on a restore that refreshs the key). (#2472)
