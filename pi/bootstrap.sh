# Pi harness bootstrap — runs ONCE on first boot, as root, cwd /root/workspace, sh.
# Pi is fully FILE-based: it reads $HOME/.pi/agent/{models,settings}.json,
# so there is NO env-based config to defer to launch.sh. The two config files are
# COMMITTED real files (seed files) carrying placeholders; this script only fills
# the handful of runtime values it can't commit (proxy base, token, default model).
# The LIVE model catalog is fetched per-boot in launch.sh (not one-shot here), so a
# first-boot GET /models transient self-heals on the next boot; this script only
# SEEDS a valid models.json with the default model. Skip the proxy fill gracefully
# when the proxy env is absent (the CLI then falls back to the user's own creds).
# Config paths are $HOME-relative — the dispatcher decides HOME (old: workspace, new: /root).
