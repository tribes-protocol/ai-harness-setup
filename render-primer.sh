# Render the agent primer (AGENTS.md, + CLAUDE.md for harnesses that read it)
# from the pristine template, substituting the box's CURRENT identity.
#
# Why this exists as its own script, called from BOTH bootstrap.sh and launch.sh:
# bootstrap.sh runs ONCE, and its sed CONSUMES the placeholders — so anything it
# stamped is frozen for the life of the disk. That is wrong for every value here:
#
#   - __HOST__  the guest's OS hostname is the BOOT SLUG (the baked warm-pool
#               name). A claim adds the chosen name as a DNS alias + vhost and
#               does NOT reboot the VM, so `hostname` NEVER becomes the claimed
#               public name. A box bootstrapped in the warm pool therefore froze
#               a primer saying "you are live at <pool-slug>" — and since the
#               agent auto-loads AGENTS.md, it was fed a WRONG public URL by
#               default. The control plane passes the real one as
#               TRIBES_PUBLIC_HOST once the name is claimed.
#   - identity  a box bootstrapped BEFORE its agent_identities row is bound has
#               no TRIBES_IDENTITY_* in env, so the once-only sed froze "none"
#               for email/EVM/SOL permanently.
#
# Running this every launch (the same restore-safety pattern launch.sh already
# uses for the proxy token) re-renders from the untouched template with the live
# env, so a stale or "none" primer SELF-HEALS on the next launch and the values
# survive restore. Idempotent: it always renders from the template, never from
# the already-substituted output.
#
# POSIX sh. Never fails the caller: a fetch/render problem leaves the existing
# primer in place rather than truncating it or aborting boot.

# TRIBES_PUBLIC_HOST (the claimed public FQDN, emitted by the control plane at
# claim) is the ONLY authoritative source. There is deliberately NO fallback to
# $HOSTNAME/`hostname`: the guest's hostname is the BOOT SLUG, and since a claim
# only adds a DNS alias and never renames the VM, it can never equal the claimed
# name on an adopted box. Falling back to it would not degrade gracefully — it
# would deterministically re-render the original bug (a confidently WRONG public
# URL) precisely when delivery failed. A missing line makes the agent check or
# ask; a wrong line makes it act on a falsehood. Absent → unknown, never a guess.
