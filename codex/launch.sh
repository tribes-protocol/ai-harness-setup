# Exports the env-based config that config.toml's env_key reads, then execs the
# harness with its yolo flag (--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox = never
# ask, never sandbox; the VM is the security boundary).

# config.toml's [model_providers.tribes] reads OPENAI_API_KEY as the Bearer
# token. Only export when present so an unset proxy key lets Codex fall back to
# the user's own credentials.

# The proxy guard above skips config when TRIBES_API_KEY is empty — correct for a
# BYO box (all three env vars unset). But a box the control plane marked
# proxy-routed (TRIBES_LLM_MODEL + API_BASE_URL present) that arrives with an
# EMPTY TRIBES_API_KEY is a FAILED credential mint, not BYO: it boots, every LLM
# call 401s (totalTokens:0), and every other vantage reads green. Surface it — a
# loud boot-log line AND a health marker the fleet can poll — so "booted with no
# proxy auth" is no longer silent. Cleared on any healthy/BYO boot so the marker
# is a LIVE signal (self-heals on a restore that re-mints the key). (#2472)
