# bootstrap.sh's sed CONSUMED the primer placeholders, freezing whatever the box
# knew at first boot: the boot-slug hostname (a claim adds a DNS alias and never
# renames the VM) and "none" identity values if the agent_identities row wasn't
# bound yet. AGENTS.md is auto-loaded into the agent's context, so a frozen primer
# feeds it a WRONG public URL by default. Re-render from the untouched template
# with this launch's live env so both self-heal and survive restore.

# drive that predates skills (old image, dev backend) and for a pinned
# TRIBES_HARNESS_REF (QA), which must exercise that branch's own installer.
# Tolerant + tight timeout; a slow or failed fetch leaves the launch (and any
# prior install) unaffected.

# --- platform-funded but NO credential: fail LOUD, don't boot silently broken ----

# BYO box (all three env vars unset). But a box the control plane marked
# platform-funded (TRIBES_LLM_MODEL + OPENROUTER_API_KEY present) that arrives with an
# EMPTY $token (the platform-provided OpenRouter placeholder supplied nothing) is a FAILED provider-key delivery, not BYO: it boots, every LLM
# call 401s (totalTokens:0), and every other vantage reads green. Surface it — a
# loud boot-log line AND a health marker the fleet can poll — so "booted with no
# proxy auth" is no longer silent. Cleared on any healthy/BYO boot so the marker
# is a LIVE signal (self-heals on a restore that refreshs the key). (#2472)
