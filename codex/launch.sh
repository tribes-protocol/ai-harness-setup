# Codex harness launch — runs on EVERY launch, as root, cwd /root/workspace, sh.
# Exports the env-based config that config.toml's env_key reads, then execs the
# harness with its yolo flag (--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox = never
# ask, never sandbox; the VM is the security boundary).

# config.toml's [model_providers.tribes] reads OPENAI_API_KEY as the Bearer
# token. The bearer is minted in-VM by tribes-agent-token (an ES256 JWT signed
# with the P-256 agent key); export it only when non-empty so a keyless BYO/
# external box lets Codex fall back to the user's own credentials.

# --- shared agent skills: refresh to the latest published set every launch ---
# This is the mechanism that makes template-based sandboxes pick up newly
# published skills without any repo change. Tolerant + tight timeout; a slow or
# failed fetch leaves the launch (and any prior install) unaffected.
