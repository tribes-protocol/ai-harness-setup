# Codex harness launch — runs on EVERY launch, as root, cwd /root/workspace, sh.
# Exports the env-based config that config.toml's env_key reads, then execs the
# harness with its yolo flag (--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox = never
# ask, never sandbox; the VM is the security boundary).

# config.toml's [model_providers.tribes] reads OPENAI_API_KEY as the Bearer
# token. Only export when present so an unset proxy key lets Codex fall back to
# the user's own credentials.
# --- re-render the agent primer (restore-safety, like the token refresh) -----
# bootstrap.sh's sed CONSUMED the primer placeholders, freezing whatever the box
# knew at first boot: the boot-slug hostname (a claim adds a DNS alias and never
# renames the VM) and "none" identity values if the agent_identities row wasn't
# bound yet. AGENTS.md is auto-loaded into the agent's context, so a frozen primer
# feeds it a WRONG public URL by default. Re-render from the untouched template
# with this launch's live env so both self-heal and survive restore.
