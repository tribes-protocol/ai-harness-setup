# --- config -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The committed seed .codex/config.toml has two layers:
#   1. trust/yolo (approval_policy, sandbox_mode, [projects."/root/workspace"]) —
#      ALWAYS keep; the microVM is the security boundary, so codex must be
#      fully non-interactive regardless of which provider it talks to.
#   2. proxy routing (model, model_provider, [model_providers.tribes]) — only
#      valid when the metered proxy env is present.
# Proxy present  → fill the proxy placeholders, keep the whole file.
# BYO (proxy env unset) → strip ONLY the proxy bits so codex falls back to its
#      own provider/creds while staying auto-approved + trusted. No raw
#      __TRIBES_* placeholders survive either way.
# Done with `bun` (smol-toml) for a robust structured edit, not fragile sed.
# Gate on a mintable bearer (ES256 JWT from the in-VM P-256 key, via
# tribes-agent-token) so a keyless BYO/external box strips the proxy bits below;
# the token itself is env-only for codex (OPENAI_API_KEY, exported in launch.sh).
