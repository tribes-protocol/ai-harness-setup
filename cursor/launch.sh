# cursor harness — launch (runs on EVERY launch, as root, cwd /root/workspace, under sh).
# Cursor cannot be pointed at the metered LLM proxy (no base-URL override), so
# auth is the user's OWN Cursor account: `/login` in the TUI, or CURSOR_API_KEY
# if the env carries one — we pass the inherited env through untouched. No
# tribes token lives in any file, so there is no per-launch token refresh.

# No browser exists in the VM — make `agent login` PRINT its auth URL instead
# of trying to open one, so the user completes OAuth on their own machine.
# --- re-render the agent primer (restore-safety, like the token refresh) -----
# bootstrap.sh's sed CONSUMED the primer placeholders, freezing whatever the box
# knew at first boot: the boot-slug hostname (a claim adds a DNS alias and never
# renames the VM) and "none" identity values if the agent_identities row wasn't
# bound yet. AGENTS.md is auto-loaded into the agent's context, so a frozen primer
# feeds it a WRONG public URL by default. Re-render from the untouched template
# with this launch's live env so both self-heal and survive restore.
