# knew at first boot: the boot-slug hostname (a claim adds a DNS alias and never
# renames the VM) and "none" identity values if the agent_identities row wasn't
# bound yet. AGENTS.md is auto-loaded into the agent's context, so a frozen primer
# feeds it a WRONG public URL by default. Re-render from the untouched template
# with this launch's live env so both self-heal and survive restore.

# --- platform-funded: point claude at the metered LLM proxy --------------------

# OPENROUTER_API_KEY; the provider placeholder is supplied in-VM by the platform-provided OpenRouter placeholder (a
# short provider placeholder signed with the P-256 agent key). Point claude's Anthropic
# Messages surface at `https://openrouter.ai/api`; ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN is sent as
# the Authorization: Placeholder header. If the proxy env is absent or the box is
# keyless (BYO/external — no available placeholder) we skip and claude falls back to
# whatever creds the user supplies. Kept even though settings.json's env block
# (below) covers the same values: it's what actually authenticates the launched
# harness if the on-disk config was ever left mid-edit (bootstrap fill failure) or
# a BYO box flips to platform-funded on a restore (bootstrap already ran once and
# won't re-seed the placeholders).
# Read the placeholder once; both the env export and the on-disk refresh below use it.

# loud boot-log line AND a health marker the fleet can poll — so "booted with no
