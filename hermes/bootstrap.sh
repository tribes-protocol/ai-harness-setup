#!/bin/sh
# Hermes harness bootstrap — runs ONCE on first boot, as root, cwd /root/workspace, sh.
# Installs the Hermes CLI, then fills the placeholders in the COMMITTED seed config
# $HOME/.hermes/config.yaml. Hermes is fully FILE-based: it reads
# model/provider/skin from that file, so there is NO env-based config to defer to
# launch.sh. launch.sh re-seds the display.skin line each launch so a theme toggle
# takes effect on relaunch. Config paths are $HOME-relative — the dispatcher
# decides HOME (old: workspace, new: /root).
set -e

# --- install ----------------------------------------------------------------
# --skip-setup: the Nous installer otherwise runs an INTERACTIVE `hermes setup`
# wizard that reads /dev/tty and blocks bootstrap.sh forever (the dispatcher never
# reaches its launch loop). We seed config.yaml ourselves below, so skip the wizard.
#
# --skip-browser: this is the boot-speed fix. WITHOUT it the installer's
# `node-deps` stage runs `playwright install --with-deps chromium`, which downloads
# the ~170MB Chromium engine AND apt-installs the heavy X11/nss/atk/font system-lib
# stack — by far the slowest part of a cold boot (measured ~42s on a fast-network
# host, minutes on a slow one). A proxy-routed chat agent in a microVM never drives
# a real browser, so none of that is needed on the interactive boot path. CRUCIAL:
# --skip-browser does NOT skip the node-deps the TUI needs — the installer ALWAYS
# runs `npm install` first and only gates the `playwright install chromium` step on
# this flag (see install_node_deps in the Nous install.sh). Verified empirically:
# with Chromium absent, hermes still paints its full TUI (welcome banner, input
# box, status line) — there is no degraded/spinner-gallery UI. This corrects the
# 07dcc0c revert, whose premise ("--skip-browser drops node-deps the TUI needs")
# does not hold for the current installer. (HERMES_DISABLE_LAZY_INSTALLS=1 in
# launch.sh already stops any runtime lazy re-install attempt, so the browser tool
# simply reports "unavailable" instead of blocking startup.)
#
# Redirect the installer's output to a log, NOT the terminal: the Nous install.sh
# still emits "Get:/Unpacking/Setting up" lines (python/node deps), which fill the
# in-VM bridge's scrollback; on the exit->bash reconnect the bridge REPLAYS that
# whole buffer — flooding the fresh socket so the sandboxd:validate exitToShell
# probe (a single `echo` in the dropped bash) is buried and bash looks dead. The
# other harnesses install one quiet npm/binary, so their replay is tiny; keep
# hermes's bootstrap equally quiet. `|| true` so a non-zero installer exit can't
# abort bootstrap (which would drop the once-only marker and re-run everything).
if ! command -v hermes >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # Run the installer under `script` so it sees a PTY (isatty), then discard
  # script's OWN stdout to /var/log + /dev/null. Why both: (1) a plain
  # `... >/log 2>&1` makes the installer's stdout a NON-tty, and the Nous
  # install.sh then builds a degraded TUI (the agent comes up missing its full
  # UI), which breaks the resize check. (2) Letting it write to the terminal fills
  # the bridge scrollback with the install log, which the exit->bash reconnect
  # replays and buries the exitToShell probe. `script` gives it a real tty (full
  # TUI build) while keeping every byte off the dispatcher terminal.

  # --- post-install prune ----------------------------------------------------
  # hermes installs HERE, on first boot, onto the VM's own disk (it is no longer
  # pre-baked into the shared rootfs — the bake cost ~511MB on EVERY sandbox's
  # disk, hermes or not). Trim the payload the running agent never reads — the
  # cloned repo's git history/docs/tests, the musl twins of the glibc node
  # bindings, venv bytecode, and the npm/uv install caches — ~180MB. Same list
  # the old bake-time slim used; the boot path (venv + gnu bindings) is intact.
  # Best-effort: a miss must never abort bootstrap.
