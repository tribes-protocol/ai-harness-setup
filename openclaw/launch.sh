# OpenClaw config is entirely FILE-based (exec-approvals.json + openclaw.json,
# written by bootstrap.sh) — there is no env-based config and no theme knob.

# --- restore-safety: refresh the proxy token from the LIVE env --------------
# bootstrap.sh baked TRIBES_API_KEY into openclaw.json ONCE, on first boot. A
# PAUSE -> RESTORE re-mints the per-sandbox key (the old token is REVOKED and a
# fresh TRIBES_API_KEY rides the boot cmdline), but the restored disk still holds
# the OLD, now-revoked token — so openclaw would 401 against the proxy. launch.sh
# runs EVERY boot with the live env, so re-point the on-disk apiKey at the current
# token here. No-op on a cold boot; skipped on BYO/unset (file removed, or no key).
# Config paths are $HOME-relative — the dispatcher decides HOME (old: workspace,
# new: /root).

# --- BYO onboarding ----------------------------------------------------------
# In BYO mode bootstrap.sh deleted the proxy-seeded openclaw.json, and
# `openclaw tui --local` then boots a normal-looking TUI on a default model
# with NO credentials — no auth guidance, every message fails. On the first
# BYO boot run `openclaw onboard` (interactive onboarding for credentials,
# gateway, and workspace) so the user lands in setup; the /opt/tribes marker
# keeps later relaunches out of the wizard (rerun anytime: `openclaw onboard`).

# published skills without any repo change. Tolerant + tight timeout; a slow or

# --- proxy-routed but NO credential: fail LOUD, don't boot silently broken ----
# The proxy guard above skips config when TRIBES_API_KEY is empty — correct for a
# BYO box (all three env vars unset). But a box the control plane marked
# proxy-routed (TRIBES_LLM_MODEL + API_BASE_URL present) that arrives with an
# EMPTY TRIBES_API_KEY is a FAILED credential mint, not BYO: it boots, every LLM
# call 401s (totalTokens:0), and every other vantage reads green. Surface it — a
# loud boot-log line AND a health marker the fleet can poll — so "booted with no
# proxy auth" is no longer silent. Cleared on any healthy/BYO boot so the marker
# is a LIVE signal (self-heals on a restore that re-mints the key). (#2472)
